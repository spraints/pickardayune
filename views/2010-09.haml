    %h4 September!
    %p I can't believe it's September already.
    %p Growing up in the city, September meant that fall was definitely here.
    %p Living on a farm now, I am adjusting to the realization that September is the second peak month of the summer.

    %h4 Electric Fence Report
    %p Matt was zapped while carrying the chicken water lid in one hand and the chicken water fountain in the other. The lid hit the fence, and he was curious what the twitching was. Then he set the fountain down, and twitched violently enough to drop the lid.
    %p Lisa was zapped while turning on the drip irrigation. She made herself a conductor, with her head on the fence wire. If she acts a little funny in the beginning of September, blame the jolt!
