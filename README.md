This is just a goofy little app I wrote as a "newspaper" for
the closest thing to a "town" where I live. It's fairly
spartan, which meant my meager design skills were adequate
for the task.

It started as a [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com) app, but it
required a push each time I wanted to update the content.

Now it's a [rails 3](http://rubyonrails.com) app.

Check it out at [pickardayune.com](http://pickardayune.com)!
